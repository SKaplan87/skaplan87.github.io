  <h3>About</h3>
<p>Scott Kaplan is a full-stack developer who graduated from General Assembly’s Web Development Immersive in May 2017. While capable in front-end design, his strength lies in back end logic, problem solving, and data manipulation.

Outside of coding, Scott is passionate about health and fitness (he works part time as a personal trainer), dogs (he has one and sometimes fosters others), binge watching tv (currently on the newest season of House of Cards at the time of writing this), and doing volunteer work (mostly with homeless and underprivileged children).

With his warm disposition, positive attitude, and sense of humor, Scott proves to be an asset in any group he is in. He is ready to take on whatever challenges come his way!
