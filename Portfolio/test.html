        Built with Ruby on Rails, HTML, JavaScript, Materialize, and Devise<br><br>
        This was a group project. The focus was more on collaboration and using github. We created a planning app that allows you to create tasks for different teams. You can view all tasks for you across all of your teams, or view all of the tasks for a specific team. A spotify iframe allows you to listen to music as you work on your task. Track what tasks have been completed, and how much is left to do of those that are not yet done. A giphy API and random compliment generator are included to make even the boring tasks a little more fun!<br><br>
