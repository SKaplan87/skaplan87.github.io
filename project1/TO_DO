Scroll text across screen after each shot
"GOOOAL" or "MISS"

  add goalie sprites for each team

Add play defense function.
  works the same as shot, but you control the goalie

set game to move with background

create more shooting areas

change shooting functionality to create power/accuracy based on when you click and how long you hold the click
    if this happens, create basketball game

clean up code
